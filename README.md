## Framework
For our projects, we decided not to build off of rendering engines but start from scratch. Essentially,  we want to build our own ray tracer using C++ in vs code. We plan to work collaboratively through github. There are two parts to this project, a learning part, and a practice part. For the learning part, we will follow through the tutorial (see here: https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) which leads up to a .mmp image displaying multiple objects with different properties. For the spin-off practice part, we plan to experiment and iterate on different materials, objects, properties, and light sources. In addition to .mmp images, we also want to generate .gif. See more below.

## Learning Plan
Follow through the tutorial, link: https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io (there is a tutorial associated with this github page that we’re learning from).
Watch “The Cherno” Ray Tracing Series on YouTube.

## Simple Example Application
We will ray trace different objects, which will potentially be shown through a short video panning through a “scene” of objects.
We will play around with different materials (glass, rubber, wood, etc.), different objects (cylinder, sphere, prisms, etc.), different properties (reflection, texture, etc.), and different light sources(intensity, color, position, etc.)
