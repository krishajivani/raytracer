# Ray Tracer
## Team:
Krisha Jivani, Taylor Jiang, Tenghao Li

## Project Summary
We created a ray tracer from scratch using C++. <br /> <br />
Phase 1: We explored general functionality and object properties by creating a project with the following features:
* sphere and cube implementation
* different material  properties such as matte, metal, dielectric/glass, and emissive
* triangle intersection and rendering basic polygon meshes
* bounding box technique for acceleration
* moveable camera with a changeable vertical perceivable field and foci 
<br />
Phase 2: We expanded on the above implementation by implementing a bounding box + KD tree acceleration structure, multithreading, texture mapping and anti-aliasing, spherical lights, and subsurface scattering


## Resources/Libraries
For learning how to implement a basic ray tracer and some of the feature implementations, we used:
* Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley (and a bit of Ray Tracing the Next Week)
* Scratchpixel tutorials
<br />

For subsurface scattering, we referenced the following: <br />
* A Practical Model for Subsurface Light Transport (Henrik Wann Jensen, Stephen R. Marschner, Marc Levoy, Pat Hanrahan) <br />
* Advanced Computer Graphics - Sub-Surface Scattering (Liam Gibbs)
